# GameView.cs

## Overview

`GameView.cs` is a Unity MonoBehaviour that serves as the primary view component in the game's MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It is responsible for referencing and managing all major UI and game components, facilitating communication between the game's visual elements and its underlying data model and logic.

## Key Components

### Model Reference

- **Model:** A reference to the `GameModel` instance, allowing the view to display data from the model.

### UI Components

- **StartGameMenu:** Reference to the start game menu UI component.
- **LevelUpWindow:** Reference to the level up window UI component.
- **GameOverWindow:** Reference to the game over window UI component.
- **HudBar:** Reference to the HUD (Heads-Up Display) bar UI component, which displays player stats and other in-game information.

### Game Components

- **Player:** Reference to the Player object, allowing direct access for updating player-related visuals.
- **WorldManager:** Reference to the WorldManager, which handles the management of game levels and environments.

## Usage

`GameView` acts as a central hub for accessing and updating the game's UI components based on interactions and changes in the game state. It enables:

- Displaying and hiding specific UI windows (e.g., level up, game over) based on game events.
- Updating the HUD with current player stats and information.
- Accessing player and world manager components for direct manipulation or display updates.

## Example Usage

In the game controller or other game logic scripts, you might interact with `GameView` like so:

```csharp
// To update HUD with new player stats
gameView.hudBar.UpdateStats(player.stats);

// To show the game over window when the player dies
gameView.gameOverWindow.Show();
